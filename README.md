 # Strong Password Generator
 This generator uses the random and string library to generate a defined length of random letters, digits and symbols.

 ## How it works
> [!IMPORTANT]
> A strong password should be over 16 characters in length and avoid common phrases or words. That is why I use a complex randominzed key.

Firstly, select your password length. Again, select something equal to or over 16 characters.
```
Password length (At least 15 is recommended) >>> 16
```
It will generate a string based on the chars variable and randomise as necessary.
```
Password length (At least 15 is recommended) >>> 16
